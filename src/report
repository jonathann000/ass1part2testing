Explanation of insert():
In the method insert we replaced the breaks in the for loop with return statements instead,
this is because the break caused the program to add the element either way.

Explanation of intersect():
In the intersect method we initiate int i outside of the for loop so that we can remove the
rest of the elements afterwards. Before this change the method had a bug where if the set
calling the method was longer than the one it compared to the set returned would contain the
elements on index spaces larger than the other set.

Explanation of distinctClosed():
We changed the nested for loop so that both i and j instantiated at zero,
this is because the - operator isn’t commutative so we need to check every combination of elements.
We changed the if statement so that the method checks both that the result of the operation is not
a part of the set and that the elements that the operator is applied to isn’t the same.
If the if statement returns false for all combinations in the set the method returns true.
We also made it a requirement that the set would contain 2 or more elements, otherwise the
function isn’t applicable in our point of view.
